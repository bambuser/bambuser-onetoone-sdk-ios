# Release Notes

This SDK is currently an experimental alpha.

It will follow semver only after the first major release. Until then, it may (and most probably will) have breaking changes between minor versions. 
Make sure to always use the latest version of the SDK. There is no guaranteed backwards compatibility while in alpha.

## Release 0.1.0

This is the very first alpha release. It includes the possibility to create a agent tool view, minimize it, drag it in minimized state and maximize it back again to full size. This for both UIKit and SwiftUI.

Demo, documentation and the readme is in constant work in progress and will be improved and extended in coming versions.
